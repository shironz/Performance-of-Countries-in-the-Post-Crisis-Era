# Performance-of-Countries-in-the-Post-Crisis-Era

ABSTRACT:

This paper examines the performance of 144 countries in the world before, during, and after the 2007--2012 global financial crisis. Fully nonparametric methods are used to estimate technical efficiencies. Recently-developed statistical results are used to test for changes in efficiencies as well as productivity over time, and to test for changes in technology over time. We also test for these differences between developing and developed countries. We find evidence of the non-convexity of countries' production set. The data revealed that technical efficiency declined at the start of the global financial crisis (2006--2008), but recovered in the years later (2008--2014), ending higher in 2014 than in 2004. We also find that mean productivity continued decreasing from 2004 to 2010. Moreover, productivity in 2004 stochastic dominants in the first order that in 2014. Statistical tests indicate that the frontier continued shifting downward from 2004 to 2010, and then continued shifting upward from 2010 to 2014. Overall, the technology has shifted downward from 2004 to 2014. Finally, we provide evidence that developing economies have lower technical efficiency but higher productivity than developed economies over this period.
